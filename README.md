# Bank_Loan_Analysis-

## Overview
This project involves the development of a data-driven analytics dashboard that visualizes key loan metrics, application trends, and financial insights. The dashboard provides financial institutions with a powerful tool to enhance decision-making using scalable and distributed data processing methods. The visualization is built with **Tableau** and backed by **SQL** for data queries, with additional data handling in **Excel**.

## Features
- **Loan Metrics Visualization**: Displays important metrics such as loan approvals, rejections, loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment trends.
- **Application Trends**: Analyzes loan application volumes over time, segmented by various factors such as loan type, customer demographics, and geographical location.
- **Financial Insights**: Provides deep insights into loan performance, defaults, and customer profiles, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
- **Scalable Processing**: Built with distributed data processing in mind to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.
- **Excel**: For initial data pre-processing and analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing the loan datasets from the database.
- **Data Sources**: Integrated from multiple financial data systems.

## Installation and Setup
To view or modify the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-loan-analysis-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Open the **Tableau** file (`bank_loan_dashboard.twbx`) in Tableau Desktop.

3. Ensure you have the relevant datasets and connect Tableau to your local or remote SQL server:
   - If necessary, update the database connection settings within Tableau to point to your SQL server.
   - Run the SQL scripts provided in the `sql_queries` folder to set up the necessary tables and queries.

4. Open the **Excel** files in the `data` folder for any pre-processed data.

## Usage
Once the dashboard is set up, you can:
1. **Explore loan metrics**: Interact with visualizations to see key trends in loan approvals, rejections, and repayments.
2. **Filter data by region or loan type**: Customize your view to analyze specific subsets of data.
3. **Track application trends**: Visualize how loan applications vary by time, region, and demographics.
4. **Gain insights**: Use the insights provided by the dashboard to support decision-making processes.

## Key Visualizations
- **Loan Application Trends**: Displays the number of applications over time, allowing users to filter by loan type and geography.
- **Loan Performance Metrics**: Breaks down approval rates, interest rates, repayment status, and default rates.
- **Customer Demographics**: Visualizes borrower profiles by age, income, loan amount, and credit history.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time data streaming to provide up-to-date financial insights.
- Expand the dashboard to include predictive analytics, helping stakeholders forecast future loan trends.
- Add additional layers of data visualization to analyze the impact of external economic factors on loan performance.
